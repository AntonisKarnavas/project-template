# Instructions

* Never edit the requirements.txt file
* This is not dummy implementation. This is a real implementation not a mock application. This will go to production. If you require something from an external service to make the real implementaion, ask for it from the developer.
* All the tests that you add must be real tests, do not mock. The only exception is the social authentication tests.
